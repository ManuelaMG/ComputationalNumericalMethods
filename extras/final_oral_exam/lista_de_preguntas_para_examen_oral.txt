List of 30 questions for the oral exam. The answers can be very short. For example:

Q1: What does this operation do: x=np.random.randint(1,100,10) ?
A1: Generates 10 integers between 1:99	

Q2: how does Euler method work? (differential equations) 			
A2: estimates next point from the previous point and the derivative at this point 

Q3: What is the difference between Runge-Kutta method (RK) and Euler metod?  	
A3: RK is similar to Euler method but the derivative is calculated in more complex way (using more points), so RK is more precise

Q4: how does LU decomposition work 						
A4: decomposes matriz into lower and upper matrix and then does backward/forward substitution
